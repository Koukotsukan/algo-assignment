cn = 'Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/London-03 May 2022: Fitch Ratings has cut its forecast for China’s 2022 GDP growth to ' \
     '4.3%, from 4.8%. Meanwhile, the agency revised its 2023 growth forecast slightly higher to 5.2%, from 5.1%, ' \
     'on the assumption that the government will phase out its ‘dynamic zero-Covid’ policy only gradually over the ' \
     'course of next year. Policies adopted by the authorities since mid-March to contain the spread of the Omicron ' \
     'strain of Covid-19 have led to an extended lockdown in the important commercial hub of Shanghai, and a rise in ' \
     'public health and mobility restrictions across China (A+/Stable) more broadly. Spillover to economic activity ' \
     'from Covid-19 pandemic-related disruption became apparent in March, with retail sales falling by 3.5%, ' \
     'the first yoy decline since mid-2020. Selected sub-components contracted even more severely; for example, ' \
     'catering was down by 15.6% yoy. Other areas of activity, including industrial production and fixed-asset ' \
     'investment, also slowed noticeably, as health and movement controls disrupted domestic supply chains and labour ' \
     'availability. Recent mobility trends suggest that China’s growth momentum deteriorated significantly in April, ' \
     'with traffic congestion, subway passenger volume and other high-frequency indicators at their weakest since the ' \
     'initial outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020. We expect the disruption to ease this month, as nationwide ' \
     'infections appear to be down from their mid-April highs and the politburo has indicated its desire to improve ' \
     'coordination between pandemic control and economic development. However, we still expect a qoq GDP contraction ' \
     'in 2Q22, before output recovers in 2H22. Our forecast remains subject to downside risk if containment measures ' \
     'fail to bring new outbreaks under control quickly or if the easing of current restrictions is delayed, ' \
     'given our assumption that China will strictly adhere to ‘dynamic zero’ until 2023. Policymakers remain ' \
     'committed to China’s 2022 GDP growth target of around 5.5%, which appears unlikely to be met on current trends. ' \
     'Officials signaled their intention to boost macro policy support in light of downward pressure on growth at ' \
     'recent meetings of the politburo and the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, which were led ' \
     'by President Xi Jinping. We expect infrastructure investment to accelerate over coming quarters. Issuance of ' \
     'local government Special Bonds this year was front-loaded, which should support a ramp-up of related spending ' \
     'in 2H22, provided that pandemic-related restrictions are eased. We forecast a further cut to the reserve ' \
     'requirement rate and the medium-term lending facility policy rate. However, adjustments are likely to be modest ' \
     'against the backdrop of monetary policy tightening by other major central banks and the Chinese authorities’ ' \
     'caution that rising interest rate differentials may spark capital outflow pressures. Nonetheless, ' \
     'we expect policy easing to boost credit growth; our adjusted credit growth measure rose by 10.5% yoy in March, ' \
     'and should accelerate - given the central authorities’ infrastructure development plans and a recent relaxation ' \
     'of housing measures by numerous local governments. Fiscal policy has also been loosened. We estimate the budget ' \
     'deficit will widen to 5.8% of GDP this year, from 4.4% in 2021, but the resulting increase in government ' \
     'debt/GDP will be modest, at about 2pp. We forecast debt/GDP will remain slightly below 60% in 2022, broadly in ' \
     'line with the ‘A’ peer median. A further rise in macro-financial risks associated with a persistent easing of ' \
     'credit conditions, or a sustained rise in public debt/GDP, could lead to negative action on China’s rating. ' \
     'However, we assume that the approaching upturn in economy-wide leverage will be modest and short lived, ' \
     'given the concern for financial stability issues demonstrated by China’s leadership in recent years. '

ca = "OTTAWA, April 29 (Reuters) - The Canadian economy most likely grew by an annualized 5.6% in the first quarter, " \
     "official data showed on Friday, well ahead of the Bank of Canada's recent projections, reinforcing the " \

     "February from January, beating analyst estimates of 0.8% growth and gaining for a ninth consecutive month. The " \
     "economy likely grew by 0.5% in March, Statscan said in its flash estimate. The flash estimate for first-quarter " \
     "annualized growth was much higher than the 3.0% forecast published by the Canadian central bank earlier this " \
     "month. The economy posted broad-based increases as COVID-related restrictions were eased, Statistics Canada " \

us = """New York (CNN Business)America's economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter of 2022, data from the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Thursday. The nation's gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic 
activity -- declined at an annualized rate of 1.4% between January and March in an abrupt reversal of the prior 
year's strong growth. While one quarter does not yet make a trend, it is a warning sign for how the recovery is 
going: Two straight quarters of declining growth meet a commonly used definition of a recession. It was a marked 
slowdown from the 6.9% growth pace recorded in the final quarter of last year, and the worst performance since the 
pandemic recession in the second quarter of 2020. Economists had predicted an annualized growth rate of 1.1%, 
according to Refinitiv. Despite the lower numbers, President Joe Biden categorized the US economy as "resilient in 
the face of historic challenges," in a statement released Thursday morning. "While last quarter's growth estimate was 
affected by technical factors, the United States confronts the challenges of Covid-19 around the world, 
Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and global inflation from a position of strength," the statement said. What 
drove the decline? Much of the first quarter decline in the United States was due to a decrease in inventory 
investment, which had been booming in the final months of 2021. That means the GDP decline should be taken with a 
grain of salt, warned Ryan Sweet, senior director of economic research at Moody's Analytics, on Wednesday before the 
data was published. Exports and government spending also fell, while imports rose. Consumer spending, which is vital 
to the economy, increased as prices kept rising. Americans spent more on services, led by health care. That offset a 
small decline in goods spending, which shrank due to lower spending on gas. Gas prices shot through the roof in 
response to Russia's war in Ukraine, which jolted energy markets around the world. The price index tracking personal 
consumption expenditure rose 7% in the first three months of the year, or 5.2% when stripping out energy and food 
prices. "It is unfortunate that this GDP rate did not meet expectations, but unsurprising as the US economy remains 
very volatile with geopolitical turbulence from the war in Ukraine, a global supply chain crisis, increasing 
inflation and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic," said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, in emailed 
comments. "All of these factors have shrunk GDP growth rates around the globe." A second estimate of first quarter 
GDP growth will be published at the end of May. What this means for the Fed The unexpected GDP decline likely didn't 
change the immediate outlook for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The central bank, which is starting to 
reverse course after a period of ultra-loose policies during the pandemic, is expected to raise interest rates next 
week. It would be the second rate hike of the year. The vast majority of market participants expect a 
half-percentage-point increase, up from the quarter-point hike announced in March. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman 
Jerome Powell said a bigger rate hike was on the table for the May meeting. "The Fed will continue to press on the 
policy brakes with increased determination over the coming months as inflation shows pesky persistence," said Greg 
Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. While economists still hope that March may have marked the pandemic inflation 
peak, only the April economic data, which is still some weeks out, can confirm that. On Friday, the Commerce 
Department will report the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, price index for March. Correction: An earlier 
version of this story incorrectly stated that the economy expanded in the first quarter of the year. """

uk = """LONDON — A growth slowdown is underway in the U.K. after the economy shrank by 0.1% in March, with economists 
expecting further contractions this year. Although the economy grew 0.8% for the first quarter as a whole, 
slightly below consensus forecasts for 1% growth, January was the only positive month of the quarter. The war in 
Ukraine and subsequent supply chain problems and energy price spikes have compounded the toll of inflation, 
which is running at a multi-decade high. Sterling hit a two-year low versus the U.S. dollar following the data as 
traders digested growing uncertainty about the U.K.’s economic outlook. The surprise monthly contraction in March — 
economists had expected the figure to come in flat — presents a worry for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government 
as the country’s cost-of-living crisis is yet to reach its peak. “Ultimately, things are only going to get worse for 
consumers. Energy bills are expected to soar again later this year when the price cap is reassessed, while inflation 
is proving stickier than expected,” said Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors. U.K inflation hit a 
30-year high of 7% in March and in April, the country’s energy regulator increased its price cap by 54% to 
accommodate soaring prices. In the Queen’s Speech to mark the state opening of parliament on Wednesday, 
the government promised to focus on economic growth in order to address the spiraling cost of living. Strategist: Why 
the UK economy is ‘one of the most vulnerable’ in the world Patel added that the Bank of England now faces a “near 
impossible task of managing the economy out of this quagmire.”They are in aggressive rate raising mode for now, 
but this cannot remain the case for long given the economic issues already starting to play out,” he added. The Bank 
of England has hiked interest rates at four consecutive policy meetings as it looks to rein in inflation, and markets 
are pricing in another five hikes by spring of 2023. However, James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, 
suggested that the central bank’s more cautious tone in recent weeks indicates that it will not meet these 
expectations, and may settle for a couple more hikes before hitting pause so as not to exert further downward 
pressure on economic growth. Thursday’s GDP figures also showed that the U.K.’s dominant consumer-facing services 
industry took a substantial hit in March, falling 1.8% as consumer spending declined amid the squeeze on households. 
Health spending to fall away ING’s Smith said a second consecutive decline in output should be expected in April, 
coinciding with the end of free Covid-19 testing. “Surprisingly, health output actually increased in March despite 
the ongoing wind-down of Covid-related activities, but clearly, that’s unlikely to last,” Smith noted. If inflation 
data starts to turn that will give us a big bounce in the markets, says Jim O’Neill “Health spending has been a key 
driver of GDP through the pandemic, and in fact, the overall size of the economy would be around 1% smaller had 
output in this sector stayed flat since early-2020.”Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global 
Wealth Management, was also cautious looking ahead. “There is growing potential for U.K. GDP to be negative in the 
second quarter, which is in part due to the consumer squeeze from energy price rises,” she said. U.K. stocks 
insulated As concerns about the growth outlook in the coming quarters grow, investors are also considering the impact 
it could have on markets. However, Simmons noted that the U.K. economy is not representative of the U.K. equity 
market. UBS sees upside to the FTSE 100 index with a December target of 8,100; the FTSE was trading around 7172 
mid-morning Thursday. Importantly for the U.K., both labor demand and business investment intentions remain firm, 
reducing the risk of a sharp downturn in overall growth, according to Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at 
Tilney Smith & Williamson.  BOE chief economist says biggest drivers of UK inflation are external shocks The Bank of 
England expects growth to be flat in the second quarter, though Casali also noted that there is potential for a 
modest contraction. “For investors, given that the large cap U.K.-listed companies derive the bulk of their sales 
abroad, it really is global growth that matters,” Casali added. The IMF recently reduced its global growth forecast 
to 3.6% for 2022 and 2023, from 6.1% last year. “Along with the sharp EPS gains made by the energy sector, 
the outlook for UK company profits has improved. The consensus forecasts 15% Earnings Per Share growth for 2022, 
a big pick-up from just under 3% at the start of the year,” Casali added. “At the very least, rising company earnings 
(and cheap valuations) should limit U.K. equity downside in current volatile market conditions.” """
